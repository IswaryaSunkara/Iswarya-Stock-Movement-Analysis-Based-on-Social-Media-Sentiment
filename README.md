This project predicts stock price movements by analyzing social media sentiment. It scrapes data from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram, performs sentiment analysis, and uses machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVR) to forecast stock trends, evaluating The Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment project aims to predict stock price movements by analyzing user-generated content from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram. The process begins with data scraping, where relevant discussions are extracted using APIs such as Tweepy for Twitter, PRAW for Reddit, or Telethon for Telegram. The collected data undergoes preprocessing to remove noise and handle missing values, ensuring it is suitable for analysis. Sentiment analysis is then performed to determine the polarity of the content (positive, negative, or neutral), providing insights into public opinion. Finally, the processed data is used to train machine learning models that predict stock price trends, with model performance evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This approach combines the power of web scraping, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling to draw meaningful connections between social media sentiment and stock market movements.with metrics like RMSE for accuracy.
